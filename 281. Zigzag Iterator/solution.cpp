/*
Given two 1d vectors, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.

Example:

Input:
v1 = [1,2]
v2 = [3,4,5,6] 

Output: [1,3,2,4,5,6]

Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, 
             the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,3,2,4,5,6].
Follow up: What if you are given k 1d vectors? How well can your code be extended to such cases?

Clarification for the follow up question:
The "Zigzag" order is not clearly defined and is ambiguous for k > 2 cases. If "Zigzag" does not look right to you, replace "Zigzag" with "Cyclic". For example:

Input:
[1,2,3]
[4,5,6,7]
[8,9]

Output: [1,4,8,2,5,9,3,6,7].
