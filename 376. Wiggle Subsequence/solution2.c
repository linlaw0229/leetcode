                    Proof: We consider a subsequence of type D in {0,...,i-1} (its length is down[i-1]).
                    Let N be the last number of this subsequence.
                    - If nums[i] > N, then we can add nums[i] to the subsequence and it gives us a longer
                    valid subsequence of type U.
                    - If nums[i] <= N, then:
                    (1) N cannot be nums[i-1], because nums[i-1] < nums[i] <= N i.e. nums[i-1] < N
                    (2) We can replace N with nums[i-1] (we still have a valid
                    subsequence of type D since N >= nums[i] > nums[i-1] i.e. N > nums[i-1]),
                    and then add nums[i] to the subsequence, and we have a longer subsequence of type U.
                    Therefore up[i] = down[i-1] + 1
                    
                    There is no gain in using nums[i] to make a longer subsequence of type D.
                    Proof: Let N be the last number of a subsequence of type U
                    in {0,...,i-1}.
                    Assume we can use nums[i] to make a longer subsequence of type D. Then:
                    (1) N cannot be nums[i-1], otherwise we would not be able to use nums[i]
                    to make a longer subsequence of type D as nums[i] > nums[i-1]
                    (2) Necessarily nums[i] < N, and therefore nums[i-1] < N since nums[i-1] < nums[i].
                    But this means that we could have used nums[i-1] already to make a longer
                    subsequence of type D.
                    So even if we can use nums[i], there is no gain in using it, so we keep the old value of
                    down (down[i] = down[i-1])
